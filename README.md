## Project Overview

**Towntor** is a responsive, multipage real estate website built for the final web development assignment. The site demonstrates semantic HTML5 structure, responsive CSS, and JavaScript interactivity. It showcases property listings (featured/new/popular), property categories, testimonials, a blog/news section, and contact functionality. The site is designed to be production-ready, organized, and deployable on static hosting platform  Vercel.

**Primary goals**

* Deliver a clear, accessible user experience for browsing properties.
* Use semantic HTML5 and mobile-first responsive CSS.
* Implement interactive features with JavaScript (search, mobile nav, form validation).
* Organize production-ready code and deploy the site.

## Pages / Site Map

* `index.html` — Home (hero search, featured properties, categories, testimonials, CTA)
* `about.html` — About the agency and mission/history
* `property.html` — Listings grid with filters and categories

* `service.html` — Services the agency offers (buying, selling, staging)
* `Contact.html` — Contact form and contact details

## Features & Requirements Implemented

* **Responsive design**: Mobile-first breakpoints, header/footer consistency.
* **Semantic markup**: Use of `<header>`, `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`.
* **Interactive elements** (JavaScript):

  * Mobile toggle menu
  * Search form handling (city/address/zip)
  * Simple client-side form validation for contact form

* **Accessible practices**:

  * Descriptive alt text for images
  * Proper heading hierarchy
  * Focus styles for keyboard users
* **Organized project structure** and modular, commented code.

## Known Issues & Future Improvements

* Data is static — consider adding a backend or static JSON to manage properties dynamically.
* Add search suggestions / autocomplete for the search input.
* Implement contact form server endpoint or Netlify Forms for real submissions.
* Add pagination and advanced filtering on `properties.html`.
* Add unit tests / accessibility automated tests.
